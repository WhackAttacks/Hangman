# Hangman Game
This JavaScript application allows users to play the classic hangman game. Users can select a category (fruits, animals, or countries) and guess letters to uncover the hidden word.

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open index.html in your preferred web browser.
## Usage
Upon loading the application, you will be prompted to select a category (fruits, animals, or countries) by clicking on the respective button.
Once a category is selected, a random word from that category will be chosen, and dashes representing each letter of the word will be displayed.
Click on the letter buttons to guess the letters of the word.
If the guessed letter is correct, it will replace the corresponding dash(es) in the word.
If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn on the canvas.
Continue guessing letters until the word is fully revealed or the hangman figure is completed.
Click on the "New Game" button to start a new game.
## Features
Choose from three categories: fruits, animals, or countries.
Real-time drawing of the hangman figure as incorrect guesses are made.

Option to start a new game after completion.
